Visualizing US Natural Disasters

**1.Problem Statement:**
Natural disasters in the United States occur frequently and vary by type, location, and time. However, raw disaster data is complex and difficult to interpret without proper analysis. This project aims to clean, analyze, and visualize US natural disaster data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

**2.Dataset Description:**
Source: US Natural Disaster dataset (FEMA-based)
Number of Rows: 60,000+ disaster records
Number of Columns: 30+ attributes
Key Columns Include:
Disaster Type
State
Incident Begin Date
Incident End Date
Declaration Date
Disaster Closeout Date
Damage Category

**3.Recommendations:**
Integrate real-time disaster data APIs for continuous dashboard updates.
Include economic loss and casualty data to enhance impact analysis.
Add predictive analytics to forecast future disaster trends.
Improve dashboard interactivity with advanced filters and drill-downs.
Perform state-level comparative analysis for better regional planning.

**4.Tools Used:**
Power BI: Used for data transformation, modeling, and interactive dashboard creation.
Power Query: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.
Kaggle: Used as the data source to obtain the US natural disaster dataset for analysis and visualization.
GitHub: Used for version control, project documentation, and collaboration.
Notepad / Markdown: Used for maintaining data cleaning documentation and README files.
