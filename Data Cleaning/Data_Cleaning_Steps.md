Data Cleaning Steps – Power BI (Power Query)
1. Dataset Import
   -Imported the raw Disaster Declaration Summaries dataset into Power BI Desktop.
   -Opened Power Query Editor to perform all data-cleaning operations before loading data into the model.
   
2.Data Type Validation and Correction
   -After importing the raw dataset into Power BI, the first step was to verify the data types of all columns in Power Query     Editor.
    -Each column’s data type was reviewed to ensure it correctly represented the nature of the data.
    -Incorrect or automatically assigned data types were manually corrected to avoid calculation and visualization errors.
    
3.Column Name Standardization
    -Renamed column headers to make them clear, readable, and consistent.
    -Converted column names to Title Case for professional documentation.
    
4.Replace Values
    -Replaced inconsistent or incorrect values with standardized values to ensure uniformity and improve data accuracy for analysis and visualization.
    
5.Removed Columns
    -Remove repeated columns and unwanted columns which are not necessary for data visualization.
    
6.Text Data Standardization
    -Applied text standardization to categorical fields by converting all values to uppercase, ensuring uniform representation  and improved grouping during analysis.
    
7.Removing NULL values
    -removed NULL values to get data visualization more effectively.
    
8.Text Data Cleaning
    -Trimmed leading and trailing spaces from text columns.
    
9.Final Data Validation
    -Rechecked row counts before and after cleaning to ensure no unintended data loss.
    -Reviewed sample records for correctness and consistency.
    -Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI for visualization and analysis.
    
10.Output
    -Final cleaned dataset is analysis-ready.
